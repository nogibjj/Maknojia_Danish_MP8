# Performance Analysis of Fibonacci Data Processing

## Overview

This document details the performance analysis of a Rust program that processes Fibonacci numbers. The program computes a product and sum of filtered Fibonacci numbers for a given input set and measures the execution time and memory usage.

## Input Data

The input data used for the test is a vector of unsigned 128-bit integers:

```rust
let data_input: Vec<u128> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19];
memory_usage = 868352;
runtime = 105375;
results = (0, 33);
```
