# Performance Analysis of Fibonacci Data Processing

## Overview

This document details the performance analysis of a Python program that processes Fibonacci numbers. 
The program computes a product and sum of filtered Fibonacci numbers for a given input set and measures the execution time and memory usage.

## Input Data

The input data used for the test is a list of integers:

```python

    data_input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
    memory_usage = 0.015625
    runtime = 3.910064697265625e-05
    results = (0, 33)
